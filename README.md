# Emotion Recognition In Conversation with Transformer and Relational Graph Transformer

In this project, based on the DialogueGCN  [[1]](#1), we proposed new flows the have better performance than the original paper. 

In the DialogGCN, their flow is as show in the below image

In our methods, we changed the sequence context to Transformer, and RGCN to Relational Graph Transform, which better generalize and have global information.

In our methods, Relational Graph Tranformer having the same properties as Graph Transformer Architecture [[2]](#2)

For the coding, we use DGL library [[3]](#3)
